This is the PANDORA 2.0 spectral DNS code. All source code is in ./src/. To compile the code, use
make
make pandora
make clean

There is a configuration file pandora.conf that is copied to the hidden directory ~/.pandora with
make configure

The documentation is generated by doxygen using
make doxygen

It can then be found in ./doc/, where also the doxygen configuration file code.dxg can be found. The recommended way of accessing the documentation is the html version. ./doc/html/todo.html shows the TODO list.

To use pandora, copy the input file ip_file.in from ./conf/ to a work directory and run the script runp2 found in ./scripts (adapted to the correct paths and version of mpirun). For testing and verbose output set the relevant parameters in the configuration file ~/.pandora/pandora.conf.
